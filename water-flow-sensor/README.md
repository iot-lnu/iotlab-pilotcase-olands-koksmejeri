# YF-S201 tests

Below is a summary of [Sensor informmation](https://components101.com/sensors/yf-s201-water-flow-measurement-sensor) found online.
|Flow(L/H)|Frequency(Hz)|
---|---
|120|16|
|240|32.5|
|360|49.3|
|480|65.5|
|600|82|
|720|90.2|

## Water through sensor using a funnel


| Water poured (L) | Water measured (L) | Pulse flow formula     |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 0.75             | 0.63               | Freqiency = Flow x 7 |
| 0.75             | 0.5                | Freqiency = Flow x 8 |

Funnel is to big and water can't be poured without spilling

## Test with hose

Freqiency = Flow x 8. Measure pulse s for 1 s at a time. The sensor was attatched to a hose. Around 25 L of water was poured. Sensor reported 20.58 L.

###  Freqiency = Flow x 7

7.5 is the recomended value according to google, due to a misstake were I used "int" instead of "float" we use the value 7.
doing several tests to see cositancy. The fact that Im pumping a very small amount each try could throw the ressults off, everything is more inconsistant in the begining and end of each pour.
while measuring I am holding the meater and the hose together with my hand. A lot can vary between each test, this could affect the dramatic difference between results.

#### Several tests with larger volumes of water

For these tests, exept for pouring more water each test, a hose is attatched to the sensor using an adapter. This could also affect the consitancy of the results.

| Water weight (kg) | Water YF-S201 (L) | YF-S201/weighed |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| 9.4               | 8.68               | 0.9234                         |

| 10.7              | 9.98               | 0.9327                         |
| 10.7              | 10.02              | 0.9364                         |

| 10.2              | 9.63               | 0.9441                         |
| 9.8               | 9.25               | 0.9439                         |
| 10.2              | 9.65               | 0.9461                         |
| 10.2              | 9.38               | 0.8933                         |

| Mean YF-S201/weighed | Standard deviation YF-S201/weighed |
|------|--------------------|
|0.93432  | 0.016152317     |

For larger volumes of water, the STD is a lot smaller. The measured values deviate more than one STD from the expected value, this indicates that adjustments to the code could make the results of the measurements better.

#### Weighthed results

For this attempt, the measurements are weighted according to the results from the previous test. The mean value of the measurements for 1 liter of water was 0.93432 so the results will be weighed with a factor of 1/0.93432 = 1.0753
