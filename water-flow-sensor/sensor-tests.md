# YF-S201 tests

Below is a summary of [Sensor informmation](https://components101.com/sensors/yf-s201-water-flow-measurement-sensor) found online.
|Flow(L/H)|Frequency(Hz)|
---|---
|120|16|
|240|32.5|
|360|49.3|
|480|65.5|
|600|82|

## Water through sensor using a funnel


| Water poured (L) | Water measured (L) | Pulse flow formula     |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 0.75             | 0.63               | Freqiency = Flow x 7.5 |
| 0.75             | 0.5                 | Freqiency = Flow x 8.2 |

Funnel is to big and water can't be poured without spilling
