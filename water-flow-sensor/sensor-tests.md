## Water through sensor using a funnel


| Water poured (L) | Water measured (L) | Pulse flow formula     |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 0.75             | 0.63               | Freqiency = Flow x 7.5 |
| 0.75             |                  | Freqiency = Flow x 8.2 |
